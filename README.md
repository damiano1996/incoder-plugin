- A dedicated **tool window** appears on the right panel of the IDE after installing the plugin.
- Interact with an LLM to:
  - **Generate code snippets** or solve coding challenges.
  - **Understand code** by analyzing the file or specific lines you're viewing.
  - Get contextual suggestions and explanations based on the active file you're working on, as the LLM has access to the current code.

### 2. **Inline Code Completion**

- **Real-time suggestions** while you type in the editor.
- Press **Tab** to accept the suggested code and insert it directly into your file.
- Accelerate your coding workflow with intelligent autocompletion that understands the context of your project.

### 3. **Support for Multiple LLM Providers**
- InCoder supports **multiple LLM providers**, giving you flexibility and choice:
  - **Ollama**: Utilize models running locally on your machine to preserve privacy.
  - **OpenAI**: Access advanced cloud-based LLMs for high-quality suggestions and assistance.
  - **Anthropic**: Integrate with this leading LLM provider for ethical and powerful AI capabilities.
- All providers can be easily **configured** through the plugin's settings, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

### 4. **Privacy-Focused Local LLM Support**
- By using **Ollama**, InCoder enables local LLM inference directly on your computer.
- Keeps sensitive project data private and ensures compliance with internal security policies.
- Ideal for developers who value privacy and want to avoid sending data to external servers.

## Settings
The plugin is highly customizable through the **InCoder Settings** panel in your IDE. Access it via the settings/preferences menu under the section **InCoder**. 
Configuration is divided into three main subsections:

- **Chat**: Configure settings for the interactive chat window, such as history retention and UI preferences.
- **Inline**: Enable or disable inline code completion and customize the behavior (e.g., auto-suggestions, Tab behavior).
- **Server**: Set up your preferred LLM provider.

## Benefits of Using InCoder
- **Boost productivity**: Generate boilerplate code, debug faster, and understand unfamiliar codebases more quickly.
- **Enhanced contextual understanding**: The LLM has access to your active file, ensuring accurate and relevant suggestions tailored to your project.
- **Customizable and flexible**: Easily switch between LLM providers to adapt to your workflow or organizational requirements.
- **Seamless integration**: Designed specifically for JetBrains IDEs, ensuring an intuitive and native user experience.

## Experimental Features
- **Inline code completion** is currently experimental but highly promising for real-time code assistance and efficiency. Feedback is welcome to improve this feature further.

## Supported JetBrains IDEs
While InCoder is primarily tested on **IntelliJ IDEA** and **PyCharm**, it is compatible with most JetBrains IDEs, making it a versatile choice for developers working in diverse environments.
