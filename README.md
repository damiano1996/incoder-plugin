</p>

* **File tool:**

    * **Scan directory**: lists files and folders.
    * **Read file**: returns content with **line numbers** (great for precise edits).
    * **Create empty file**: safely creates files only if they don‚Äôt exist and **refreshes the project** view.

#### MCP Tools

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/readme/chat-settings.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="Command Line Demo">
</p>

* InCoder can **attach to MCP servers** and surface their tools directly in chat.
* Tools are **discovered dynamically** (e.g., filesystem, editor, shell, git from compatible servers).

### Inline Code Completion

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/readme/demo-inline.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="Inline Code Completion">
</p>

* **Real-time inline suggestions** (ghost text) while you type.
* Press **Tab** to accept; stays out of your way when you don‚Äôt need it.
* Context-aware across the current buffer; configurable in settings (feature is evolving fast).
